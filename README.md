## CS Career Recommendation Chatbot

The CS Career Recommendation Chatbot is designed to assist computer science students on the verge of graduation in navigating their career paths. Utilizing a conversational AI model, the chatbot engages students in meaningful dialogue, asking pertinent questions to discern their career preferences and strengths. Through a personalized approach, it offers tailored career advice, spotlighting computing jobs that align with the students' identified interests and capabilities. Additionally, the chatbot provides resources for further exploration of recommended paths and facilitates follow-up discussions to refine its suggestions based on user feedback.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Career Advice**: Tailors suggestions based on the student's responses about preferences and strengths.
- **Diverse Career Options**: Covers a wide range of computing careers including Software Developer, Data Scientist, Network Administrator, Cybersecurity Analyst, and AI Researcher.
- **Interactive Engagement**: Engages users in a natural, conversational manner, enhancing the guidance experience.

## Training Cases

The chatbot has been trained on two primary cases, reflecting common concerns among computer science students:

1. **Students Proficient in Coding but Uncertain of Career Path**: Utilizes AIML to guide technically skilled students towards careers like software development or AI research.
2. **Students Interested in Technology but Not in Math**: Suggests less math-intensive careers such as network administration or cybersecurity, leveraging AIML for personalized guidance.

These scenarios demonstrate the chatbot's capacity to adapt to a variety of student preferences, ensuring relevant and constructive career advice.
